Data Types:
    integer - whole number
    string -text
    double - decimal number
    Char - one character
    Boolean - true/false.
Variable Declaration:
    var a(name of the variable) :(data type i.e "Int, String, Double"- the data types must be sentence case; uppercase should start)
    var a = 23 ~this is without saying data type yet it will still identify it (hereby as integer)
        var is a dynamic type of variable declaration compared to val which is static type

    val z: Int
    y = 24
    val y: String
    x = "Yours Truly"

        with val a variable cannot be re-assigned i.e z = 35 will fail.
        the first is applied throughout; it is static

    Variable values:
    a = 23 ~if a was an integer

    Variable usage:
    println(a+another_var)

    var summation = a+b
    println(summation)

    var age: Int
    age = 18
    var height: Int
    height = 45
    println("Your age is $age and height is $height") ~ concatenation is by dollar sign before a variable name
        or
    println("Your age is " +age+ " and height is " +height) ~ concatenation as well
    output - Your age is 18 and height is 45

    and here is referred by &&
        i.e (age>0&&<18)
            println("You are a child")
